### Building a REST API with Flask, MySQL, Docker, and React

This guide outlines the steps to create a REST API using Flask, MySQL database, Docker, and integrate it with a React frontend.

### Step 1: Prepare MySQL Database
- Ensure you have MySQL server installed.
- Create the necessary database and tables to store data. You can use SQL commands or database management tools like phpMyAdmin.

### Step 2: Create REST API with Flask
- Install Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy extension to connect Flask with MySQL.
- Develop API endpoints to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on data in the MySQL database.
- Configure MySQL database connection settings in the Flask application.

### Step 3: Dockerize Flask App
- Create a Dockerfile to configure the Docker container for your Flask application.
- Specify dependencies and necessary environment configurations in the Dockerfile.
- Create a docker-compose.yml file if needed to set up services to be used alongside the Flask application, such as MySQL service.

### Step 4: Display API through React
- Develop a React application using Create React App or other React application builders.
- Utilize fetch or axios to make HTTP requests to the API created with Flask.
- Set state and display the data received from the Flask API in React components.

### Example Implementation
- You can create Python models for your MySQL tables using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
- Develop API endpoints using Flask with Flask decorators like @app.route('/').
- Dockerize the Flask application with a Dockerfile that configures the environment and dependencies of the application.
- Create a React application containing components to display data from the Flask API.

### Notes
- Make sure to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow the React application to communicate with the Flask API running on a different domain.
- Don't forget to connect the Flask application to the MySQL database using the correct configuration, including host, username, password, and database name.


### Prerequisites

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
